* TODO slicing
* TODO Include any missing srfi-133 functions in csl vector for compatibility
* TODO generics? - consider chibi-generic
* TODO Maybe add a vector-sum/vector-product? maybe?
* TODO Pretty sure (vector|matrix)-append are more complex than they have to be
* TODO Add csl.permutation for functional permutation operations
* TODO Add csl.linalg combining blas/linalg functions
* IN-PROGRESS Take inspiration from racket/numpy array and matrix functions
* CANCELED fix subvector? racket standards vs scheme standards
CLOSED: [2019-04-17 Wed 23:03]
* CANCELED use srfi-25?
CLOSED: [2018-12-31 Mon 09:45]
* CANCELED explore 'shared' subvector/vector views (don't return the view itself, return view->vector)
CLOSED: [2018-11-06 Tue 01:07]
* DONE overhaul matrices
CLOSED: [2019-04-17 Wed 23:03]
* DONE provide schemey alternatives to gsl types/operations (vector to dvector etc.)
CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:38]
* DONE clean up vector and matrix exports (don't need to export the error/block stuff)
CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:37]
* DONE overhaul rng

* DONE Fix vimag for real vectors
CLOSED: [2018-10-09 Tue 01:41]
* DONE include foreign record type def of gsl_block directly in make_rvector_module
CLOSED: [2018-10-09 Tue 01:31]
- to account for block types
* DONE rename arithmetic operators symbolically (vector-add -> vector+)
CLOSED: [2018-10-07 Sun 11:54]
