* TODO slicing
* TODO Include any missing srfi-133 functions to csl vector for compatibility
* IN-PROGRESS overhaul matrices
* TODO Take inspiration from racket/numpy array and matrix functions
* TODO generics?
* TODO Maybe add a vector-sum/vector-product? maybe?
* TODO Pretty sure (vector|matrix)-append are more complex than they have to be
* fix subvector? racket standards vs scheme standards
* CANCELED use srfi-25?

* DONE provide schemey alternatives to gsl types/operations (vector to dvector etc.)
CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:38]
* DONE clean up vector and matrix exports (don't need to export the error/block stuff)
CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:37]
* CANCELED explore 'shared' subvector/vector views (don't return the view itself, return view->vector)
CLOSED: [2018-11-06 Tue 01:07]
