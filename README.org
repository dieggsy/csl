* CSL: Chicken Scientific Library

*This egg is very much still incomplete, but some basic double/complex/vector/matrix
representation and operations do currently work.*

This is a [[https://call-cc.org/][Chicken Scheme]] egg for the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/][GNU Scientific Library (GSL)]], providing
both low-level bindings and a more scheme-y api, as well as some generic
functions for convenience.
