#+title: CSL: Chicken Scientific Library

*NOTE: This egg is still very much a work in progress, but some basic vector and matrix
operations do currently work.*

This is a [[https://call-cc.org/][Chicken Scheme]] egg for the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/][GNU Scientific Library (GSL)]], providing
both low-level bindings and a more scheme-y api, as well as some generic
functions for convenience.

For GSL function/variable reference, see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/][the official gsl documentation]]. This
document will mostly parallel that, but to avoid redundancy I'll only explain
what has changed between the C and scheme apis and other such major points.
